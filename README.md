### Health Insurance Cost Analysis README

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a health insurance dataset to uncover insights into factors influencing insurance costs. Conducted purely in Python without the use of libraries like Pandas or NumPy, it demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization through foundational Python programming techniques. Key aspects include exploring the impact of demographic and health-related factors on insurance premiums, with a particular focus on the effects of age, BMI, smoking status, and the number of children.

#### Features
- **Data Processing**: Custom functions to load and parse CSV data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analysis of distributions, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Utilization of Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating insightful charts and graphs.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computation of key statistics to understand the data's central tendencies and variability.
- **Insight Generation**: Derivation of actionable insights from the data analysis, aimed at both individuals seeking insurance and policymakers designing insurance products.

#### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

##### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

##### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib seaborn
   ```

#### Running the Analysis
1. Place your dataset in the same directory as the script and name it `insurance.csv`.
2. Run the script from the command line:
   ```
   python insurance_analysis.py
   ```
3. The analysis will output several plots and statistical summaries to your terminal, providing insights into the dataset.
